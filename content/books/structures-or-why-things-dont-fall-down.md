Summary: A delightful dive into the principles behind bridges, towers, bones, and everything in between.

This book by J.E. Gordon explains structural engineering in an incredibly engaging and accessible way. It doesn't assume a technical background, but still offers deep insights into materials science, stress, strain, and the elegant physics of why things hold together â€” or don't.

Highly recommended for anyone curious about the built world around them.
